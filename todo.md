# To-do

- Undo option
    - Have a checkbox ("Safe Mode" or something)
    - If Safe Mode is checked, (probably don't worry about actually implementing a checkbox - a hardcoded const will do for now) then when they click on a bomb, it displays only the one bomb that was clicked, and they die
    - But, with Safe Mode on, they can either:
        - UNDO and continue, or 
        - END and reveal all the bombs
- Mines that tick down until you uncover more area
- Minesweeper Flags™
- User-specified dimensions
